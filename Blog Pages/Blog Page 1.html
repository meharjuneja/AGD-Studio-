        <p style="margin-top: 40px;">I can't believe it's been almost four years since we moved into our new home! One
            of the projects that have
            been on our bucket list is to revamp our patio area. We worked really hard on it and I'm so excited to
            finally share the completed project with you guys!</p>

        <p>Such a big difference from how it looked before lolâ€¦ We love it so much! This area has become our new
            sanctuary
            during the warmer weather. It kind of feels like a combination of a cabana and another addition of a family
            room
            that we get to enjoy comfortably.</p>

        <p>As you can see, we also installed artificial turf over the reddish colored deck. We really enjoy how the turf
            feels when we walk on it. It almost feels like carpet, soft, and comfortable. The turf also gives this area
            a
            cleaner and polished look and couldn't be happier with how everything turned out!</p>

        <p>Of course, I'm not going to forget to talk about one of the main decor pieces of our patio revamp! We are
            completely in LOVE with this beautiful outdoor seating!! It is very simple, elegant and so classy. It sits
            deep and it's perfect for us because my family and I are all tall lol!</p>
