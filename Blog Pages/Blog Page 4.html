        <p>This year, I have really enjoyed changing things up & decorating for Fall. I don't know if I was ready for a
            change of weather {because its was too warm for too long in California!} Or I was just ready for a new
            look…regardless, I love changes!</p>
        <p>Before I begin any further, I'm excited to share that The Bay Area Home ladies & I are doing a Fall Home Tour
            sponsored by HomeGoods.</p>

        <p>When I originally started shopping for Fall decorations, particularly gold pillows….I really didn't have any
            luck at first because I was looking for a particular shade of gold. One day, I went to my local HomeGoods
            with my mom…& it's always nice to go shopping with moms because sometimes they spot the best treasures for
            you. Like when I was shopping for gold pillows!</p>

        <p>Fall means creating an ambiance that is warm, cozy & inviting.  The thought of spending days where you just turn on the fireplace, cuddle and watch a movie with your family…with hot chocolate of coarse </p>
