            wonderful blogger friends who are also sharing their homes for the holidays.</p>

        <p>This year, I decided to add some gold and silver tones to my holiday decor. I actually decided to add the
            plaid Christmas ribbon last minute and really love how it turned out…hope you like it too ♥</p>

        <p>The month of December is just so pretty! Nevertheless, December is also one of the busiest months for us. Not
            only do we celebrate Christmas but we get to spend three birthdays, and a wedding anniversary together; five
            occasions throughout the month!! It's so crazy yet SO much fun so when I start to decorate the house for
            Christmas; it stays pretty festive for all the occasions we get to celebrate…it's a win win situation, cant
            complain. Tis the season to decorate' everyone!!</p>

        <p>I love taking out our Christmas dishes every year. I remember all those little laughs and seeing joys in my
            kids eyes whenever we shared delicious meals together. I would make them their favorite drink; hot coco with
            marsh mellows. Gathering around the table, I remember the kids feeling extra special eating from these
            dishes knowing we get to open Christmas gifts right after…it was so sweet! Ah those precious little
            memories..I would do anything to go back in time and hold them tight when they were so little ♥ Oh and I
            decided to make hearts tied with ribbons out of these candy canes</p>
